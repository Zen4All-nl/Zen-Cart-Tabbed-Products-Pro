# Zen-Cart-Tabbed-Products-Pro

Tabbed Products Pro, or 'TPP', is the successor to the original 'Tabbed Product Lite' contrib. TPP allows you to change the look of your product info screen to use a tabbed display using DHTML & Javascript for a cleaner, more organized look. Since the "Lite" version, TPP has been completely rewritten to be more optimized, and to be easily implemented & customized.

By default the following global tabs related to the informational aspects of the product page are activated:

  - Product Description
  - Product Details
  - Additional Images
  - Customer Also Purchased
  - Product Reviews
  
These additional global tabs (mostly related to the transactional aspects of the product page -- attributes, add-to-cart, upsell) are also supported:

  - Main Product Image
  - Add to Cart
  - Attributes
  - Add to Cart ON the Attributes tab
  - Cross Sell (if the **[Cross Sell Plus Advanced Sell Combo](http://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1364)** is installed)
  
Tabbed Products Pro does not alter any actual values in your store. It relies on javascript to manipulate the look of the page on your customers browser, while still keeping all of the source code intact for SEO, and w3 validation.

**Tabs are created dynamically on the display page based on tags entered right in the main product description, or by global options from the admin area.**

See the "How To Use" tab for details on how to use it. Since the original 'Tabbed Product Lite' contrib, Tabbed Products Pro has become extremely advanced in logic, and there are many different customizations that can be accomplished with Tabbed Products Pro.
